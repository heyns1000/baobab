2. Dedicated Regional Dashboard:
Eskom Crisis (South Africa) (eskom_crisis_dashboard.html): A standalone page offering real-time metrics and in-depth insights into South Africa's specific power challenges. This is accessed via a direct link in the main SPA's sidebar for a focused regional analysis.

3. Business & Information Pages:
Pricing & Plans (pricing.html): Details the various service tiers and pricing models for the Baobab Security Network's conceptual services.

About Us (about_us.html): Provides a deeper dive into the network's vision, mission, and operational philosophy.

Contact Us (contact.html): Offers ways to get in touch with the Baobab Security Network team for inquiries and support.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started:
Ready to explore the Baobab Security Network? Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

1. Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/heyns1000/baobab.git
cd baobab

2. View the Website (Static Files - Easiest Way):
No server required for local viewing! This method is ideal for quick previews.

Navigate to the cloned directory:

cd baobab

Open index.html in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
You can usually do this by double-clicking the file or dragging it into a browser tab.

From index.html, explore the various sections and navigate to the "Global Dashboards" (baobab_spa_dashboard.html) or the "Eskom Crisis" dashboard (eskom_crisis_dashboard.html) via their respective links.

Within the baobab_spa_dashboard.html, use the sidebar navigation to switch between the 11 global thematic dashboards.

To see the pricing.html, about_us.html, or contact.html pages, use the links provided in the main SPA dashboard or directly access them from index.html if linked there.

3. Run the Conceptual Backend Example (Requires Python & Flask):
This demonstrates how a simple server could deliver your pages, which is closer to a real-world deployment.

Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8 or higher is recommended).

Install the Flask web framework (if you haven't already):

pip install Flask

Make sure server_example.py is in the same directory as your HTML files (it should be if you cloned the repo).

Run the Flask server from your terminal in the baobab directory:

python server_example.py

Open your web browser and navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
